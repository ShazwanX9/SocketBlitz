Specific: 
    Gain proficiency in implementing video streaming 
    using sockets in Python.
Measurable: 
    Successfully develop a basic video streaming application 
    that streams video from a server to a client.
Achievable: 
    Acquire a good understanding of socket programming in Python 
    through tutorials, documentation, and practice exercises. 
    Break down the task into smaller, 
    manageable steps such as setting up the server, 
    establishing a connection, streaming frames, 
    and displaying video on the client side.
Relevant: 
    Video streaming is a fundamental concept 
    in network programming and has various 
    real-world applications, 
    such as security surveillance, 
    video conferencing, 
    and live video broadcasting. 
    Understanding how to implement video streaming 
    using sockets will provide valuable skills applicable 
    to a wide range of projects and industries.
Time-bound: 
    Aim to complete the development of the 
    basic video streaming application within 
    a specified timeframe, such as two weeks. 
    Set milestones for each stage of development, 
    including research, coding, testing, and documentation, 
    to ensure progress is made within the allotted time.

Steps:
    1. Start with Enstablish concurrent socket connection
    2. Transfer the frames data and broadcast to all client
    3. On receiving end, display the frames properly
    4. Integrate with past projects
    5. Prepare a GUI for it

Benefits:
    1. Learn OpenCV
    2. Improve Kivy
    3. Improve Socket
    4. Improve Threading
    5. Improve Logging

Use Case:
    1. CCTV: Server will stream the Case
    2. Receiver: Can connect to host and view the stream
